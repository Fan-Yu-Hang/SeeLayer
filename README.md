# SeeLayer
Dec6


Nov30, if necessary, we need to show more on Product Hunt.

Nov28, [new scene]. I'm confused about apps on my mac, these names are too weird to know their function. Ima, handbrake, obsidian, what are they working for? Last year i make a Feishu sheet to write down the app and the web tool, including their specifics, but time flies fast and i forget to continue. The seelayer is an assistant to mark any interface, our computer is more complex than the house we live. I believe many potential users will love this way to remark our apps on computer, why we download them, how they use, what's their pros and cons.

Nov21, indiehacker's UI is elegant.

Nov19, the forum could show many functions. The bounty mission, for instance, is really necessary for an amateur, if your boss need you to finish a target with niche software, which you cannot find tutorials on YouTube, set a 10$ bounty question, our system will invite those who may know. Before that, experts could add tags on themselves, not just software, but the industry they work. You can always find a better way, a suitable solution to solve your target. Save time, matters money.

Nov18, in my view, there are 3 ways to build our official web.

1-3 no forum, just table of softwares. It's easy to write, but no place to communicate, we must use 3rd tool like Discord. In the future it is chaos.

2-3 forum and table are seperate. Also not hard to write, for coder just need 2 subpages, 1 for table and 1 for forum. There are many examples to copy.

3-3 forum comes more important, but table is on the main page. The user interface is clean, if you are new to SeeLayer, it's easy to find the target software on table. But if you are familiar with a software and you need the advanced guidance, the only way is to find proper posts. I have several UI ideas but i don't know how to express.

Nov17, the forum system, like v2ex.com, is complex. My neighbor coder Chen recommend me the v2ex, a coder love forum, but i need a invitation number. The reason is most bad posts happened recently are from new users, founder has to close the gmail sign up. Similar thing happens on Zhihu(知乎), chinese Quora, at early stage new users could join in Zhihu by old users' invitation. With growing, more and more posts are just for fun, not for the knowledge sharing.

Lukily, PM Zhou share me an open source forum frame. She say most blockchain coders use Discourse to build BBS, it's a mature frame.

Nov15, i cannot insist to learn more Japanese on Duolingo, the sentence is hard to recite. I have the ability to read 50 syllabary chart, that's enough to take few ads to Japanese market. Consider i know German, English and Chinese, the potential user population is close to 4 billion.

Nov7, my dad highly suggest me to attach importance to Chinese market. As a 1.4 billion country, the minority is still a large amount, but he may ignore the habit. The pay usage habits in China is weak. I strongly think the user ratio about China and abroad may 3:7, but the Members who are willing to purchase, the ratio could be 7:3. Let's wait and see what will happen in 2025.

Nov4, coder Qian test the URL Scheme, a link could open the App, but we cannot sure whether single instruction could open. To be continue...

Nov1, learning Japanese is convenient to recognize Chinese characters, but hard to pronounce. Like this sentence, I am Chinese, 私は中国人です(Janpanese), 我是中国人(Chinese).

Oct31, with URL Scheme, links from official web could open the SeeLayer App on Mac.

Oct28, i ignore a group of instructions for a long time, Operation System. For instance, MacOS owns a typically clean UI, it hide many unusual functions. Let's use botton OPTION as 3 examples.

1-3, Finder Window, OPTION + mouse right botton, reopen the Finder, this helps preview file(short cut key SPACE) completely. Perhaps after a long time with cache.
2-3, Finder Desktop, OPTION + mouse right botton + 显示检查器, from 显示简介 (short cut key COMMAND+i) to 显示检查器, this helps show multi docs with single interface.
3-3, Finder Folder, OPTION + mouse left botton, if your folder is column view, it will expand all the folded docs.

We may need these tricks, but we hardly know. Me personally is a Mac lover, but learning process is a little bit time wasting.

Oct26, play tennis with my former colleague, project manager Mrs. Zhou with her Husband Mr. Li. I ask several question about how to improve SeeLayer, Li suggest to larger the LOCK icon, because this is the key function. Or I can use logo as the LOCK button, make sure eye-catching.

Oct22, i'm not sure how possible SeeLayer may become a mini LinkedIn, but instruction software may gather similar users. Last year i bring a concept named Spider-Diagram, which allow users to put urgent demands in the center, if your demands belongs to long-term like single want THE ONE, that would be on the outside circle, just like a spider cobweb. In China, every one use WeChat, few elites use co-working app like Lark(Feishu). We need a platform to show our demands, but we have little chance to express that. If we put everything on a business card, it seems like too frivolous to society. My suggestion is these text or images should rely on social software like WeChat or TikTok, not exist independently. In 2023, WeChat upgrade to allow our Moments(朋友圈) have several on top, it's a way to solve what i mention before.

Oct20, Shawarma Legned is poison. Misson all clear in 5 hrs, the AI music makes it fun. I ask my junior sister from UIC, Mrs. He, who focus on sound work in video game company. She say those games use professional software like Unity, Unreal, with built-in voice pack. SeeLayer just need voice service (Text To Speech), or record manually.

Oct19, I play the game Shawarma Legend. There are some analysis about why this game is popular, free on iPad, excellent design, and most important is music. Many web star dancing and meme on Douyin. The similar game, however, is not welcome.(WeChat Link 游民星空) https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Q1ptLZPmtStRyp6jNsyKCQ

Oct18, we could add voice on the script.

Oct16, take a dinner with coder Qian and his colleage coder He who can manage backend.

Oct15, My neighbor, coder Qian mention about email log in, and other back-end system.

Oct9, I thought the mobile version SeeLayer is impossible, but today a new app on iPad may allow it happen. Next year, we could develop desktop and mobile SeeLayer simultaneously.

2024Oct7, We have to set multiple functions to match multiple users. What DouYin (TikTok Chinese version) moves me, is that balance the clean interface and multiple functions, if you are not the target user, may never notice these details. You take an iPhone, repost a sigle comment as instant message to friend is available. The iPad, however, is not capable. The iPhone can also upload live photo as a video, or leave live photo comment under the video, android users are limited to watch. Furthermore, right-bottom corner sometimes show a camera icon, which helps the origional music widely spread. I'm a sensetive guy to collect BGM, to prepare use it in the future, it helps.

Sep11,besides pay to play, SaaS, there are several types of payment. I read an article about game history, it is helpful to build SeeLayer payment.

Sep10, Official web online.

2024Sep2, I have a good metaphor. If pirates want to explore a territorial waters, they need a pilot who new a best line. SeeLayer is that pilot.

Aug30, Nitro is not free? I try the discord and find Nitro, an emoji is totally free to me. But i could learn from this strategy.
https://help.playbackbone.com/hc/en-us/articles/4577648803095-Who-is-Eligible-to-Redeem-the-Discord-Nitro-Offer

Aug27, finally find a instruction demo https://discord.com/blog/how-to-use-discord-apps. There are many apps waiting to add on Discord, so does SeeLayer.

Aug26, i know little about Discord. A new product need the PMF(Product Market Fit), Discord is a good platform to verify. China doesn't has a open platform like this, luckily SeeLayer foucsing on the market abroad.

Aug24, i write an Email to a coder, who help me to optimise a bilibili-comment-download(B站评论助手) Chrome plug-in. I respect every types engineer, if we know little about plug-in, ask him to build is a better choice.

Aug23, the account setting is too complex. The WordPress, for instance, has over 100 choices. Users may tired about those details, rather than study game tricks to enter next level. I quit to use web tool, Notion + domain is good.

Aug21, write an article about western manufacture competitiveness. I mention the Pangdonglai, and 3 German examples, finally bring a seelayer ad.

From Zhihu (Chinese Quora) 为啥西方列强最后全不行了？ - 樊宇航ProtonFly的回答 - 知乎 https://www.zhihu.com/question/460725043/answer/3601664584

Aug20, meet up with coder Jiang in EFC. He is happy about SeeLayer, and give me several interaction advices. In mac, maximize interface will create a new desktop which mouse cannot penetrate. So the green-button should be desktop-maximize. And he introduce how his boss find investor, recite all details about investor's company history, CEO's hobby. With a chance encounter infront of door gate, with a 5 min talk, investor show interest on him. This wild experience is totally unusual due to billionaire will set a process to prearrange timetable.

Aug16, i continue to learn from other tool apps, duolingo shock me as well. Like the video mentioned, only 8.6% of its users pay, and less than 8% of its revenue comes from advertising, a free educational app manage to also have a valuation of $7.7 billion. Rely on  AI, A/B testing, mascot, and gamification strategy.
Especially for SeeLayer, gamification is our priority, even more important than software instruction list. Our users must feel toxic to learn the next step, they are willing to share to colleage or friends. And for those who are obsessed with the instruction making, gamification make the process fun.

Aug15, read an article about search engine and ad, learn a lot. I'm shocked about Aravind Srinivas's age, 1994, one year younger than me. https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/w_SAaojLO3l62YVHJzdAiw

全文有 24 处提到广告，广告收入也是 SeeLayer 非常重要的一环，我们甚至会模糊 toB 和 toC 之间的广告投放，除了传统企业，个人开发者也会来这个垂直的说明书平台，介绍自己的新发明，个人用户也会来分享自己的办公技巧，这些都是一种定向社交，2024Aug14 我了解到古早的 QQ 浏览器，以及这个插件 Side Project，都能和正在浏览同一网页的陌生人聊天，这是非常优秀的匹配机制，所谓远亲不如近邻，有相同兴趣点的用户，更像精神上的邻居。
另外，Aravind Srinivas 对于产品对应的场景，也是见解独到，比如第 5、第 7 段的 Instagram、WhatsApp，用户会对这些应用，有什么期待，哪些功能会招致反感，这是很多国内创业者不太清楚的边界感，总觉得几行代码而已，我也能加上。

Aug13, didn't expect OpenAI just apply 10 patents in 2023, but those could built the foundation of AI infrastructure. But we need to prepare SeeLayer's IP, like CV or AI Agent.

Aug10, the sales model is important. My father suggest to get discount or coupon.

Aug9, strapi is good to manage backend.

Aug8, first time to Ning Bo, 2nd largest city in Zhejiang province. The home appliance suppliers are so professional.

Aug7, watch a live from FounderPark(极客公园)about character.ai selling to Google, although the whole topic is like a philosophy session, details they mention impress me a lot. Such as, if c.ai's CEO is not Noam Shazeer, but Zhang Xiaolong from WeChat or Zhang Yiming from Bytedace, both can make a huge achievement. And last year, investors prefer infrastructure to app, which is not a good source for me. However, the individual entrepreneur also has chance, funny app and tools for industry always emerging. And for Chinese start-up should know that overseas opportunities are much larger than motherland. Creators in Silicon Valley are not so sharp to beat any opponents. Investor WANG Hua is full of knowledge and foresight, he suggest not for fake AI but for app first. Product can help users to improve the efficiency is the priority. I am so happy to know him, what i've done on SeeLayer is 100% match, ready to meet him at Beijing.

Aug6, coder Liu suggest to change the prototype due to interactive experience is bad.

Aug5, not just my app, js.design could help me to analyse other app prototype. I used to critisize interfaces are not perfect or against our habit. Well, it's time to transfer my word to image and logic.

Aug2, i think auto-play is necessary, set a 3 seconds No. show up to allow users find software button. If constantly move from dock to software, that would be too annoying.

2024Aug1, I may walk to the road which Instagram has been through, like this article mention. One reason is that they are so familiar with these network tools. Ins has billions of photo, and SL has billions of photo and location data on screen as well.

https://read.engineerscodex.com/p/how-instagram-scaled-to-14-million

July30, i share 2 biographies about Nintendo and Instagram to team, these entrepreneur are so energetic and smart, who encourage our little project to grow up stronger.

July29, if you own a project, investors will be ubiquitous.

July28, perhaps our target is to sevice the collaborative office, transparent layer is benefit for bunches of jobs.

Meeting memo:Why do we need to share our work logs?

1. As an accumulation of incidential work matters, to help pick up memory. Perhaps a difficulty reoccurs again, and you can review whether it has been solved at that time, or colleagues may get a way to help solve it now.
2. As a pasting material for weekly and monthly reports, avoid the formalism of large companies, which spending a lot of time writing reports. The priority of a tech-company is creativity.
3. As a defensive weapon against the lawsuit; in government, many civil servants have the habit of daily logging to prevent villains from blaming; when SeeLayer go overseas, we may encounter evil lawyers. The growth logs (including GitHub’s readme) are very beneficial to be an evidence.

July27, former colleague Mrs.Lu recommend an experienced project manager Mrs. Xia in the morning, after lunch, i decide to meet her. Not just we live not far in Hangzhou, but less than 20 min online talk is so smooth. She is the fastest one to understand SeeLayer's intention and propose several valuable questions, 15 yrs PM career made her knowledgeable. We sort of worked in a same blockchain company, she was in rivtower and this company comes form cryptape which i worked for several months in 2019. We drink coffee and brainstorm the future form. Although in just 3 hrs cannot list each possibilies, the final version you see must be Slide+Audio. This is a brand-new form to supplement software video tutorial.

July26, dark-mode and other interfaces lack of details, talk with coder Liu 2 hrs, he persuade me to find a professional project manager to design the pro fuctions.

July25, after a sick, i back to work

July21, me and coder Liu check the list of all functions, SeeLayer v1.0 may born in July. I have to draw several UI like operation interface and official website, which includes intro-doc to help users to understand. And donation page is also necessary, Chinese white collar has little willing to pay for a tool, the market is totally amature.

July20, my neighbor, Designer Zhang, quit from a start-up and get a JD's offer in Beijing. Today he give me several advices, like switch UI color to avoid SeeLayer and other softwares may conflict. And he met over 50 investors last year, the most impressive one is HU Zemin(胡泽民) who invest Pinduoduo(拼多多). Investors are not generous like 5 years ago due to the economy ebb, they need us to improve cash earning ability. 

July18, Designer Wang launch the stardard UI, the green elements comes from her hometown Jiangxi's magnificent mountain scene.

了解到一款很新的硬件产品，构思如下：如果华强北出了 TapXR 的平替，能迭代之前思考的定制小键盘，可以打包实现更多需求。即，作为现有键鼠输入方式的补充，也突破了 streamdeck 只能桌面办公的局限。如果定制小键盘，只能用于 SeeLayer 的办公，那么用户购买欲望会大大下降，目前我对于 TapXR 的理解，仅限于是移动办公的补充，官网演示的室内桌面输入，效率过低，唯有平板绘图的时候，切换工具比较好用

July17, i read several articles about OpenAI acquire Multi, which need an desktop entrance to get more users. Just like Google spent more than 20 billion to develop Chrome. Wish my SeeLayer will be merged or acquired by a big company in China next year. And i also find the video conference app Loom is more complex than i thought, Bytedance built a similar app Says, but closed 3 years ago. Today will spend 6 hrs to analyse them deeply. The Loom is a good example for cooperation, but chinese working everionment may not suitable.

July16, send intro video to many people, my senior alumnae in college(Hong Kong Baptist University) is interested, she works in HONY capital. The Page and No. animate is close to PS layer, we cannot waste too much time on it. Traditional way save the teaching time for new users.

July15, stay up late from 14th night to 5am, luckily the Spain get the champion and several hrs later Argentina win as well. Take line 16 to Lin'an with my dad, a traveling camp is a good environment for work. And chat with our briliant coder Liu, who point out our UI miss a lot of things. A log in interface for example, and when users change their data, what way should we save it? Like github fork the code? Or pull the request? Or like some article forum, allow to edit and submit? Me and designer need deeper changes.

July14, i spent more than 12hrs to refresh the logic of SeeLayer, from main to operation interface.

July13, full of working on final UI.

July12, 80% of the core fuctions are close to perfect.

July11, the Red Alert's UI satisfied 90% of SeeLayer content and operation interface. Beautiful art design, they spent much time on it, respect.

July9, well, if you don't know how to draw a UI, try to learn from a game. I've played Red Alert more than 21 years, the moment i need a menu and a tool bar, Yuri's Revenge inspire me. The voice could add on.

July8, the forum operation is new to me, and i'm trying to be a professional product manager.

July6, the prototype is continuing to refine, i ignore many fundamental process. Coder Liu is patient to tell more details, and i make another keynote about 'text input frame' alternative choice.

2024July5, thanks to Steve Jobs, finally i use keynote to finish the prototype animation. Jsdesign is a good tool, but transparent function need too much work. 2 days learning and working is not a waste, later we need the forum to update bunches of tutorials. And today i bought the domain seelayer.com, so lucky to own it with 78￥ per year from Aliyun, no extra fee.

2024July4, designer Wang persuade me to abadon seelayer text from logo, just 2 color board left, i am shocked due to the radical strategy. We are just start-up, not so famous as Master Card who updated their new logo only with a red and an orange circles. Later she admit that this idea makes logo look like 2 cards. And then she turns the color boards from left-up toward right-up. But now I think this is necessary because the App icon on Mac rarely has text.

2024July3, negotiate more details with an experienced coder Liu to finish the v1.0. Talk to designer Wang, she promise to help me like she used to help of proronfly's and xinxuan's logo.

2024July2, draw on jsdesign the whole day.

2024July1, Switch the PRD to prototype, i prefer jsdesign 即时设计.

2024Jun30, The negotiation with 2 outsourse coders are not smooth, they claim seelayer is too advanced to dev. I have to find other ways, either intern or full-time is acceptable. I also need bunch of presentation, to attract talents join the program, introduce the advantage to potential consumer, and investors.

2024Jun29, finish the electron class,《禹神：一小时快速上手Electron，前端Electron开发教程》, i make a script version. Later with designer, we will meet the outsource coders and develop a real demo, which can talk to VC.

Video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sE421N7M5/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_history.page.click&vd_source=0cd6298de81487a0ae2cb8b149ddfb34

Script: https://ndpcdq918n.feishu.cn/docx/CyIfd1TALoxpUrx6e1GcP1aDnvd

2024Jun28, the UI of SeeLayer is 1% of using scene, users need a forum to find tutorials in each working area.

2024Jun27, with a huge rain in Hangzhou, i learn Electron systematically. The code is not so hard as i thought, due to the need is so clear, the only focus is run as a real demo.

2024Jun26, Learning VUE.

2024Jun25, The logo draft is ok, use Tesla's element. After talking with 2 lawyers in Tianmuli, I realise the IP is not so complex. Especially for the software like SeeLayer, GUI and special code are key elements, and the sue strategy is decided by evaluation future market. Law protection is necessary, but if the market is big enough, i just need to enjoy my share. After lawyer meeting, coder Zhong, who is introduced by my Ali neighbor, give me bunches of advise about architecture, pure javascript will be too hard, i need VUE. Here is the keynote of my project intro https://www.loom.com/share/0a34ae9eeb52447598c9104ec3cc145e?sid=b5cbd291-4412-40d6-8a03-48e694aa73d5

2024Jun24, The Qwen gives multiple versions with different functions seperately, i try to merge these codes together. Closer to willing target.

2024Jun23, The drag is hard to execute in Electron, but i find a way to bypass. Double click is the location of text input, with the limitation of 8 textframe, you can delete and add new textframe to achieve drag effect.

2024Jun22, Electron is so kind to me, I know how to dev by Electron Fiddle. I ask Qwen the whole day, get the reliable code and the SeeLayer is much closer.

2024Jun16, Qwen gives me a lot of tech details, electron, apache, they can help me get the target. And Chrome's extension cannot work due to browser cannot be tranparent.

2024May30, See-Through Layer Is All You Need
Chinese brainstorm https://www.loom.com/share/c05cfd8f460049088207f71a91840cef?sid=ca31a040-8bce-4316-b359-b630390f984f
