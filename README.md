# SeeLayer
2024Jun30, The negotiation with 2 outsourse coders are not smooth, they claim seelayer is too advanced to dev. I have to find other ways, either intern or full-time is acceptable. I also need bunch of presentation, to attract talents join the program, introduce the advantage to potential consumer, and investors.

2024Jun29, finish the electron class,《禹神：一小时快速上手Electron，前端Electron开发教程》，https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sE421N7M5/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_history.page.click&vd_source=0cd6298de81487a0ae2cb8b149ddfb34, i have this caption version https://ndpcdq918n.feishu.cn/docx/CyIfd1TALoxpUrx6e1GcP1aDnvd. Later with designer, we will meet the outsource coders and develop a real demo, which can talk to VC.

2024Jun28, the UI of SeeLayer is 1% of using scene, users need a forum to find tutorials in each working area.

2024Jun27, with a huge rain in Hangzhou, i learn Electron systematically. The code is not so hard as i thought, due to the need is so clear, the only focus is run as a real demo.

2024Jun26, Learning VUE.

2024Jun25, The logo draft is ok, use Tesla's element. After talking with 2 lawyers in Tianmuli, I realise the IP is not so complex. Especially for the software like SeeLayer, GUI and special code are key elements, and the sue strategy is decided by evaluation future market. Law protection is necessary, but if the market is big enough, i just need to enjoy my share. After lawyer meeting, a coder give me bunches of advise about architecture, pure javascript will be too hard, i need VUE. Here is the keynote of my project intro https://www.loom.com/share/0a34ae9eeb52447598c9104ec3cc145e?sid=b5cbd291-4412-40d6-8a03-48e694aa73d5

2024Jun24, The Qwen gives multiple versions with different functions seperately, i try to merge these codes together. Closer to willing target.

2024Jun23, The drag is hard to execute in Electron, but i find a way to bypass. Double click is the location of text input, with the limitation of 8 textframe, you can delete and add new textframe to achieve drag effect.

2024Jun22, Electron is so kind to me, I know how to dev by Electron Fiddle. I ask Qwen the whole day, get the reliable code and the SeeLayer is much closer.

2024Jun16, first DEMO was built by a coder
