# SeeLayer

2024Jun27, with huge rain in Hangzhou, i learn Electron and VUE

2024Jun26, Learning VUE.

2024Jun25, The logo draft is ok, use Tesla's element. After talking with 2 lawyers in Tianmuli, I realise the IP is not so complex. Especially for the software like SeeLayer, GUI and special code are key elements, and the sue strategy is decided by evaluation future market. Law protection is necessary, but if the market is big enough, i just need to enjoy my share. After lawyer meeting, a coder give me bunches of advise about architecture, pure javascript will be too hard, i need VUE. Here is the keynote of my project intro https://www.loom.com/share/0a34ae9eeb52447598c9104ec3cc145e?sid=b5cbd291-4412-40d6-8a03-48e694aa73d5

2024Jun24, The Qwen gives multiple versions with different functions seperately, i try to merge these codes together. Closer to willing target.

2024Jun23, The drag is hard to execute in Electron, but i find a way to bypass. Double click is the location of text input, with the limitation of 8 textframe, you can delete and add new textframe to achieve drag effect.

2024Jun22, Electron is so kind to me, I know how to dev by Electron Fiddle. I ask Qwen the whole day, get the reliable code and the SeeLayer is much closer.

2024Jun16, first DEMO was built by a coder
