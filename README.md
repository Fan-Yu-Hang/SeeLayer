# SeeLayer

2024Jun25, The logo draft is ok, use Tesla's element.

2024Jun24, The Qwen gives multiple versions with different functions seperately, i try to merge these codes together. Closer to willing target.

2024Jun23, The drag is hard to execute in Electron, but i find a way to bypass. Double click is the location of text input, with the limitation of 8 textframe, you can delete and add new textframe to achieve drag effect.

2024Jun22, Electron is so kind to me, I know how to dev by Electron Fiddle. I ask Qwen the whole day, get the reliable code and the SeeLayer is much closer.

2024Jun16, first DEMO was built by a coder

2024May30, See-Through Layer Is All You Need
