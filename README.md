# SeeLayer

July14, i spent more than 12hrs to refresh the logic of SeeLayer, from main to operation interface.

July13, full of working on final UI.

July12, 80% of the core fuctions are close to perfect.

July11, the Red Alert's UI satisfied 90% of SeeLayer content and operation interface. Beautiful art design, they spent much time on it, respect.

July9, well, if you don't know how to draw a UI, try to learn from a game. I've played Red Alert more than 21 years, the moment i need a menu and a tool bar, Yuri's Revenge inspire me. The voice could add on.

July8, the forum operation is new to me, and i'm trying to be a professional product manager.

July6, the prototype is continuing to refine, i ignore many fundamental process. Coder Liu is patient to tell more details, and i make another keynote about 'text input frame' alternative choice.

2024July5, thanks to Steve Jobs, finally i use keynote to finish the prototype animation. Jsdesign is a good tool, but transparent function need too much work. 2 days learning and working is not a waste, later we need the forum to update bunches of tutorials. And today i bought the domain seelayer.com, so lucky to own it with 78￥ per year from Aliyun, no extra fee.

2024July4, designer Wang persuade me to abadon seelayer text from logo, just 2 color board left, i am shocked due to the radical strategy. We are just start-up, not so famous as Master Card who updated their new logo only with a red and an orange circles. Later she admit that this idea makes logo look like 2 cards. And then she turns the color boards from left-up toward right-up. But now I think this is necessary because the App icon on Mac rarely has text.

2024July3, negotiate more details with an experienced coder to finish the v1.0. Talk to designer Wang, she promise to help me like she used to help of proronfly's and xinxuan's logo.

2024July2, draw on jsdesign the whole day.

2024July1, Switch the PRD to prototype, i prefer jsdesign 即时设计.

2024Jun30, The negotiation with 2 outsourse coders are not smooth, they claim seelayer is too advanced to dev. I have to find other ways, either intern or full-time is acceptable. I also need bunch of presentation, to attract talents join the program, introduce the advantage to potential consumer, and investors.

2024Jun29, finish the electron class,《禹神：一小时快速上手Electron，前端Electron开发教程》，https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sE421N7M5/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_history.page.click&vd_source=0cd6298de81487a0ae2cb8b149ddfb34, i have this caption version https://ndpcdq918n.feishu.cn/docx/CyIfd1TALoxpUrx6e1GcP1aDnvd. Later with designer, we will meet the outsource coders and develop a real demo, which can talk to VC.

2024Jun28, the UI of SeeLayer is 1% of using scene, users need a forum to find tutorials in each working area.

2024Jun27, with a huge rain in Hangzhou, i learn Electron systematically. The code is not so hard as i thought, due to the need is so clear, the only focus is run as a real demo.

2024Jun26, Learning VUE.

2024Jun25, The logo draft is ok, use Tesla's element. After talking with 2 lawyers in Tianmuli, I realise the IP is not so complex. Especially for the software like SeeLayer, GUI and special code are key elements, and the sue strategy is decided by evaluation future market. Law protection is necessary, but if the market is big enough, i just need to enjoy my share. After lawyer meeting, a coder give me bunches of advise about architecture, pure javascript will be too hard, i need VUE. Here is the keynote of my project intro https://www.loom.com/share/0a34ae9eeb52447598c9104ec3cc145e?sid=b5cbd291-4412-40d6-8a03-48e694aa73d5

2024Jun24, The Qwen gives multiple versions with different functions seperately, i try to merge these codes together. Closer to willing target.

2024Jun23, The drag is hard to execute in Electron, but i find a way to bypass. Double click is the location of text input, with the limitation of 8 textframe, you can delete and add new textframe to achieve drag effect.

2024Jun22, Electron is so kind to me, I know how to dev by Electron Fiddle. I ask Qwen the whole day, get the reliable code and the SeeLayer is much closer.

2024Jun16, first DEMO was built by a coder

2024May30, See-Through Layer Is All You Need
Chinese brainstorm https://www.loom.com/share/c05cfd8f460049088207f71a91840cef?sid=ca31a040-8bce-4316-b359-b630390f984f
