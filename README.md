# SeeLayer
July20, my neighbor, Designer Zhang, quit from a start-up and get a JD's offer in Beijing. Today he give me several advices, like switch UI color to avoid SeeLayer and other softwares may conflict. And he met over 50 investors last year, the most impressive one is HU Zemin(胡泽民) who invest Pinduoduo(拼多多). Investors are not generous like 5 years ago due to economy ebb, they need us to improve cash earning ability. 

July18, Designer Wang launch the stardard UI, the green elements comes from her hometown Jiangxi's magnificent mountain scene.

了解到一款很新的硬件产品，构思如下：如果华强北出了 TapXR 的平替，能迭代之前思考的定制小键盘，可以打包实现更多需求。即，作为现有键鼠输入方式的补充，也突破了 streamdeck 只能桌面办公的局限。如果定制小键盘，只能用于 SeeLayer 的办公，那么用户购买欲望会大大下降，目前我对于 TapXR 的理解，仅限于是移动办公的补充，官网演示的室内桌面输入，效率过低，唯有平板绘图的时候，切换工具比较好用

July17, i read several articles about OpenAI acquire Multi, which need an desktop entrance to get more users. Just like Google spent more than 20 billion to develop Chrome. Wish my SeeLayer will be merged or acquired by a big company in China next year. And i also find the video conference app Loom is more complex than i thought, Bytedance built a similar app Says, but closed 3 years ago. Today will spend 6 hrs to analyse them deeply. The Loom is a good example for cooperation, but chinese working everionment may not suitable.

July16, send intro video to many people, my senior alumnae in college(Hong Kong Baptist University) is interested, she works in HONY capital. The Page and No. animate is close to PS layer, we cannot waste too much time on it. Traditional way save the teaching time for new users.

July15, stay up late from 14th night to 5am, luckily the Spain get the champion and several hrs later Argentina win as well. Take line 16 to Lin'an with my dad, a traveling camp is a good environment for work. And chat with our briliant coder Liu, who point out our UI miss a lot of things. A log in interface for example, and when users change their data, what way should we save it? Like github fork the code? Or pull the request? Or like some article forum, allow to edit and submit? Me and designer need deeper changes.

July14, i spent more than 12hrs to refresh the logic of SeeLayer, from main to operation interface.

July13, full of working on final UI.

July12, 80% of the core fuctions are close to perfect.

July11, the Red Alert's UI satisfied 90% of SeeLayer content and operation interface. Beautiful art design, they spent much time on it, respect.

July9, well, if you don't know how to draw a UI, try to learn from a game. I've played Red Alert more than 21 years, the moment i need a menu and a tool bar, Yuri's Revenge inspire me. The voice could add on.

July8, the forum operation is new to me, and i'm trying to be a professional product manager.

July6, the prototype is continuing to refine, i ignore many fundamental process. Coder Liu is patient to tell more details, and i make another keynote about 'text input frame' alternative choice.

2024July5, thanks to Steve Jobs, finally i use keynote to finish the prototype animation. Jsdesign is a good tool, but transparent function need too much work. 2 days learning and working is not a waste, later we need the forum to update bunches of tutorials. And today i bought the domain seelayer.com, so lucky to own it with 78￥ per year from Aliyun, no extra fee.

2024July4, designer Wang persuade me to abadon seelayer text from logo, just 2 color board left, i am shocked due to the radical strategy. We are just start-up, not so famous as Master Card who updated their new logo only with a red and an orange circles. Later she admit that this idea makes logo look like 2 cards. And then she turns the color boards from left-up toward right-up. But now I think this is necessary because the App icon on Mac rarely has text.

2024July3, negotiate more details with an experienced coder Liu to finish the v1.0. Talk to designer Wang, she promise to help me like she used to help of proronfly's and xinxuan's logo.

2024July2, draw on jsdesign the whole day.

2024July1, Switch the PRD to prototype, i prefer jsdesign 即时设计.

2024Jun30, The negotiation with 2 outsourse coders are not smooth, they claim seelayer is too advanced to dev. I have to find other ways, either intern or full-time is acceptable. I also need bunch of presentation, to attract talents join the program, introduce the advantage to potential consumer, and investors.

2024Jun29, finish the electron class,《禹神：一小时快速上手Electron，前端Electron开发教程》，https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sE421N7M5/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_history.page.click&vd_source=0cd6298de81487a0ae2cb8b149ddfb34, i have this caption version https://ndpcdq918n.feishu.cn/docx/CyIfd1TALoxpUrx6e1GcP1aDnvd. Later with designer, we will meet the outsource coders and develop a real demo, which can talk to VC.

2024Jun28, the UI of SeeLayer is 1% of using scene, users need a forum to find tutorials in each working area.

2024Jun27, with a huge rain in Hangzhou, i learn Electron systematically. The code is not so hard as i thought, due to the need is so clear, the only focus is run as a real demo.

2024Jun26, Learning VUE.

2024Jun25, The logo draft is ok, use Tesla's element. After talking with 2 lawyers in Tianmuli, I realise the IP is not so complex. Especially for the software like SeeLayer, GUI and special code are key elements, and the sue strategy is decided by evaluation future market. Law protection is necessary, but if the market is big enough, i just need to enjoy my share. After lawyer meeting, coder Zhong, who is introduced by my Ali neighbor, give me bunches of advise about architecture, pure javascript will be too hard, i need VUE. Here is the keynote of my project intro https://www.loom.com/share/0a34ae9eeb52447598c9104ec3cc145e?sid=b5cbd291-4412-40d6-8a03-48e694aa73d5

2024Jun24, The Qwen gives multiple versions with different functions seperately, i try to merge these codes together. Closer to willing target.

2024Jun23, The drag is hard to execute in Electron, but i find a way to bypass. Double click is the location of text input, with the limitation of 8 textframe, you can delete and add new textframe to achieve drag effect.

2024Jun22, Electron is so kind to me, I know how to dev by Electron Fiddle. I ask Qwen the whole day, get the reliable code and the SeeLayer is much closer.

2024Jun16, Qwen gives me a lot of tech details, electron, apache, they can help me get the target. And Chrome's extension cannot work due to browser cannot be tranparent.

2024May30, See-Through Layer Is All You Need
Chinese brainstorm https://www.loom.com/share/c05cfd8f460049088207f71a91840cef?sid=ca31a040-8bce-4316-b359-b630390f984f
